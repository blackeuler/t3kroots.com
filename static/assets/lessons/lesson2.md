# Basic Data Types in Python 
## Introduction
In the python language we are given some predefined values and functions that we can work with. Essentially these are things that dont need to be defined to use them. 

For example, `3` is a predefined value that comes installed with the python language. We can use functions such as `+` and `*` to add and multiply numbers such as `3`. There are other functions related to numbers like `3`. Such as the `str` function. The `str` function returns the string representation of any given value in python. So `str(3)` would give back the string `"3"`. And remeber a `string` is anything inside of quotation marks.

You can also create your own functions to work with number values. Say for instance you wanted to know the roman numeral that represents a particular number. Well You could write a function to do that. Or say you wanted to know what the hourly pay of a given salary. You could write a fucntion to do that. Now we will talk in more detail about Strings.

## Strings

So Strings are values in python that kind of represent words. Meaning if we were talking about the word `3` we couldnt add that to a number `3` because you cant add numbers and words. So anytime you see something in quotation marks its a string. 

There are functions that come predefined with python for working with Strings as well. I will talk about a couple of them. There is "blah".capitalize() which will take a string as input and return as output that string with the first character capitalized. So `"blah".capitalize()"` would return `"Blah"`. You can add strings in python. What that means is say we have a string `"Hello"` and another string `"World"`. We can add them together like `"Hello" + "World"`
and that would return `"HelloWorld"`. There are many more of these things but this will be enough for now.

## Lists

So we have talked about some basic values in python. But lets say you want to record your grocery list for today. You might be saying "Oh I can use a string for that". You would be correct! So you could do something like `"1.Carrots 2.Meat 3.Eggs 4.milk"` that would be a grocery list in python but you couuldnt do much else with it without pulling your hair out. Really it would be nice if there was a way of adding `lists` to python. There is! So anytime in python you see the `[]` that is a list in python. We can put values in there like numbers and strings. So we could have `[1,2,3,4]` that would be a list of numbers. Or we could have a list of strings, like our grocery store example: `["Carrots", "Meat", "Eggs", "Milk"]`. You may be wondering how we could get the 1st or 3rd item from our list well we can do that by ``["Carrots", "Meat", "Eggs", "Milk"][2]`. This tells python to return the 3rd item of the list.
